# What is maven?
Maven is a popular open-source build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. 
It provides a comprehensive framework for managing a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information, called the Project Object Model (POM).

Using Maven, you can easily specify the dependencies of your project, download and manage them automatically, build and package your project into an executable JAR or WAR file, run unit tests, generate reports, and deploy your project to a repository or server. 
Maven also supports various plugins that can be used to extend its functionality.
