# What is maven?
Maven is a popular open-source build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. 
- It follows the concept of convention over configuration, providing a standard project structure and predefined build lifecycle phases.
- Maven uses an XML-based configuration file called "pom.xml" (Project Object Model) to define project settings, dependencies, and build instructions.
