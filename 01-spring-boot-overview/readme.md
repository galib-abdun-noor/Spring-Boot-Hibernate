# What is maven?
Maven is a popular open-source build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. 
It provides a comprehensive framework for managing a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information, called the Project Object Model (POM).

Using Maven, you can easily specify the dependencies of your project, download and manage them automatically, build and package your project into an executable JAR or WAR file, run unit tests, generate reports, and deploy your project to a repository or server. 
Maven also supports various plugins that can be used to extend its functionality.

Spring Boot is a Spring module that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring framework. Spring Boot Framework is widely used to develop REST APIs

Building a traditional Spring application is really HARD. Spring Boot Make it easier to get started with Spring development and minimize the amount of manual configuration. It also resolves dependency conflicts and we donâ€™t have to configure any server manually because it has an embedded HTTP server so you can get started quickly.
