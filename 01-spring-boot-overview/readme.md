# Goals of Spring
- Lightweight development with Java POJOs (Plain-Old-Java-Objects)
- Dependency injection to promote loose coupling
- Declarative programming with Aspect-Oriented-Programming (AOP)
- Minimize boilerplate Java code

# Maven
Maven is a popular open-source build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. 
- It follows the concept of convention over configuration, providing a standard project structure and predefined build lifecycle phases.
- Maven uses an XML-based configuration file called "pom.xml" (Project Object Model) to define project settings, dependencies, and build instructions.

# REST Controller
A REST Controller is a key component in building RESTful web services using the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.
- It handles incoming HTTP requests and maps them to appropriate methods based on the request's HTTP method and URI.
- REST Controllers are typically implemented in frameworks like Spring MVC, ASP.NET Web API, or Django to handle RESTful operations.
- REST Controllers support various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, allowing clients to perform different operations on resources.

# Spring MVC
Spring MVC is a robust and flexible web framework in the Spring ecosystem which follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for building web applications.

# Spring Initializr
[Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) is a web-based tool for generating the initial configuration and project structure for Spring-based applications.
- It simplifies the process of setting up a new Spring project by providing a user-friendly interface to configure project details and select dependencies.
- Developers can choose options such as project type, language, Spring Boot version, and dependencies.
- Spring Initializr generates a downloadable project archive or provides a link to clone the project from a version control system like Git.

# POM File
The POM (Project Object Model) file is an essential configuration file in Maven-based projects.
- It is written in XML format and serves as the backbone of the project's build and dependency management system.
- The POM file contains information about the project, such as its group ID, artifact ID, version, and packaging type.
- It defines the project's dependencies, which are external libraries or modules required by the project.
- The POM file also includes build configurations, such as build plugins, goals, and profiles, to customize the build process.

# application.properties File
The application.properties file in Spring Boot is a configuration file that allows customization of various aspects of the application.
- It contains key-value pairs of configuration properties that control behaviors such as database connections, logging settings, and server configurations.
- The file is automatically loaded during application startup and provides externalized configuration, allowing modifications without changing the source code.
