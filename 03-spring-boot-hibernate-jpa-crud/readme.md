# What is Hibernate?
Hibernate is an open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for Java.
- It simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables.
- Developers can define persistent classes (entities) that represent database tables.
- Hibernate handles CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using object-oriented methods.
- It abstracts away low-level database details, such as SQL queries and connection management.

# What is JPA?
JPA stands for Java Persistence API.
- It is a specification in Java EE for object-relational mapping (ORM).
- JPA bridges the gap between object-oriented programming and relational databases.
- It allows developers to map Java objects to database tables.
- JPA provides a set of APIs for managing relational data.
- It eliminates the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
- JPA includes concepts like entities (Java classes representing database tables) and relationships between entities.
- It also provides a query language called JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) for executing queries against the mapped entities.

# What are Benefits of JPA?
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): JPA provides an abstraction layer that maps Java objects to relational database tables, allowing developers to work with objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.
- Database Independence: JPA supports multiple database vendors, allowing applications to be easily switched between different databases without significant code changes.
- Simplified Data Access: JPA provides a high-level API for performing database operations, eliminating the need to write boilerplate JDBC code. It handles tasks such as connection management, transaction handling, and caching automatically.
