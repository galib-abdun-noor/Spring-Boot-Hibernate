# What is Hibernate?
Hibernate is an open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for Java.
- It simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables.
- Developers can define persistent classes (entities) that represent database tables.
- Hibernate handles CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using object-oriented methods.
- It abstracts away low-level database details, such as SQL queries and connection management.
